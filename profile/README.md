## Hi there 👋

The Blugold Group is the Cybersecurity Club for [University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/).

We focus on providing hands-on, practical experiences which translate directly into the workforce.

We do research, we compete at competitions, we conduct red teaming excersises against live targets, and much more.

## Development

To contribute to any of our repositories, follow this development workflow:

1. Each repository has a `/develop` branch, do all work on there
2. Create your own fork of the respository
3. Make your changes
4. Push your changes to the develop branch
5. An executive board member or someone designated by them will review your changes and pull them into the main branch
